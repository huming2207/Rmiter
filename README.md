# RMITer
 
An opensource, pure & native .NET/C# library and client for RMIT University online systems.

## Disclaimer

I made this project as I hope I can write a simiular [MonashTimetable](http://joshparnham.com/projects/monash-timetable/) app for RMIT University.

This project and its source code are not affiliated with RMIT University. It also contains some API reverse engineerings which I've been inquired and later granted permissions orally from IT Service staff in RMIT (those who work in Level 3, Building 80), though they still hold the API copyrights and management rights.

This project can only be used as accessing your own personal data, not others if you don't know the accounts. So it is **NOT** a illegal hacking tool.

So far, this project is licenced under [CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 (Australian version) Licence](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/au). **Any other personnel use or modify it for commercial purpose is not allowed, unless futher permissions are granted both by me and RMIT.**
