I've done a demo app for Windows 10 Universal platform. It can load announcement messages from myRMIT portal. Here are some screenshots:

## Example

**This example illustrate the procedure of reading your myRMIT announcements' title.**

```csharp
string username = "s1234567";
string password = "who_the_hell_knows_your_password";

var casLogin = new RmiterCore.CasLogin(); 
var cookie = await casLogin.RunCasLogin(username, password);
var myRmitPortal = new MyRmitPortal(cookie);
var homeObject = myRmitPortal.GetHomeMessages().Result;

foreach(var announcement in homeObject.Announcements)
{
      Console.WriteLine("[Title] \"{0}\"", announcement.Title);
}
```
